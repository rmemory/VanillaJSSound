This is one of several projects to demonstrate usage of vanilla usage of JS. No frameworks like JQuery, etc. Just plain old JS.
This project associates a sound and HTML transition with a particular keycode. Just open it in your browser. There is some feeble attempts in the styling to handle both mobile and larger screens. 

See this website for a quick and easy way to display keycode values: http://keycode.info/

This is based on and originates from a demo from Wes Bos. I've added a few comments, reorganized some styling, added (weak) support for mobile, added mouse click support, etc. But the original idea and structure is from him.
